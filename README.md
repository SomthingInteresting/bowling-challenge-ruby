# Bowling Challenge

This is a solution to the bowling challenge in Ruby. The challenge is to write a program that calculates the score of a bowling game.

## How to use

Clone this repo and run bundle install to install the dependencies.

To run the tests, run rspec from the command line.

To run the program, run irb from the command line and require the file.

## Approach

I started off by diagramming the program and the classes I would need. I decided to have a Game, Frame, Roll & Scoreboard class.
